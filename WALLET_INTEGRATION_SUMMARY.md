## Architecture

```
apps/web/src/
├── lib/wallet/
│   ├── walletAdapter.ts      # Core wallet logic
│   ├── WalletContext.tsx     # React Context
│   └── README.md             # Documentation
├── components/ui/
│   └── WalletButton.tsx      # UI component
├── components/auction/
│   └── CreateAuctionWizard.tsx  # Updated to use wallet
└── pages/
    ├── index.astro           # Homepage with wallet button
    └── auctions/
        └── new.astro         # Auction creation with wallet button
```

## Data Flow

1. User clicks "Connect Wallet" button
2. WalletButton triggers `connectWallet()` from context
3. Context calls wallet adapter's `connectWallet(provider, network)`
4. sats-connect library communicates with browser wallet extension
5. User approves connection in wallet popup
6. Wallet returns payment and ordinals addresses + public keys
7. Context stores wallet data and saves to localStorage
8. UI updates to show connected state
9. CreateAuctionWizard can now access `wallet.paymentAddress`
10. Seller address is automatically populated in API call

## API Integration

The wallet integration is now used in the auction creation API call:

```typescript
// Before
body: JSON.stringify({
  // ...
  sellerAddress: 'tb1q...', // TODO: Connect wallet
})

// After
body: JSON.stringify({
  // ...
  sellerAddress: wallet.paymentAddress, // From connected wallet
})
```

## Security Considerations

1. **No Private Keys**: The integration never accesses or stores private keys
2. **User Approval**: All transactions require explicit user approval in the wallet
3. **Network Validation**: Network type is validated before connection
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling prevents crashes
5. **localStorage**: Only non-sensitive data (addresses) stored locally
6. **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures proper data handling

## Testing Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd /workspace/apps/web
   bun install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

3. **Install a Wallet**
   - Install Unisat, Leather, or Xverse browser extension
   - Create/import a wallet
   - Switch to testnet in wallet settings

4. **Test Connection**
   - Visit http://localhost:4321
   - Click "Connect Wallet" in header
   - Select your wallet from the menu
   - Approve connection in wallet popup
   - Verify address is displayed

5. **Test Auction Creation**
   - Navigate to /auctions/new
   - Verify wallet connection status is shown
   - Fill out auction form
   - Submit and verify seller address is populated from wallet

6. **Test Persistence**
   - Connect wallet
   - Refresh the page
   - Verify wallet remains connected

7. **Test Network Switching**
   - Connect wallet
   - Open wallet menu
   - Click "Switch Network"
   - Select different network
   - Reconnect wallet

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Transaction Signing**: Implement PSBT signing for actual Bitcoin transactions
2. **Wallet Balance**: Display user's Bitcoin balance
3. **Transaction History**: Show past auction transactions
4. **Multi-signature Support**: Add support for multi-sig wallets
5. **Hardware Wallet Support**: Integrate Ledger/Trezor
6. **Analytics**: Track wallet connection metrics
7. **ENS/BNS Support**: Display friendly names if available
8. **QR Code**: Generate QR code for wallet address

## Known Limitations

1. **Browser Only**: Wallet connection only works in browser environments
2. **Extension Required**: Users must have wallet extension installed
3. **No Mobile**: Mobile wallet support not included (requires WalletConnect or similar)
4. **Single Address**: Currently uses only payment address for auctions
5. **No Transaction Signing**: Actual Bitcoin transaction signing not implemented yet

## Acceptance Criteria Status

- ✅ User can click "Connect Wallet" and select a wallet provider
- ✅ Wallet address is displayed in the UI when connected
- ✅ Seller address field in auction creation is auto-populated from connected wallet
- ✅ Wallet connection persists across page reloads (localStorage)
- ✅ Clear error messages for wallet connection failures
