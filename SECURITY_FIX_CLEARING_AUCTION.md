# Security Fix: Clearing Auction Server-Side Verification

## Issue Identified
The `POST /api/clearing/create-auction` endpoint was vulnerable to bypass attacks. Malicious actors could POST directly to the endpoint and create auctions for inscriptions they don't own, bypassing the client-side verification.

**Severity:** P1 (High) - Critical security vulnerability

## Root Cause
The clearing auction endpoint only validated that required parameters were present, but did not verify:
1. The seller actually owns the inscriptions
2. The inscriptions are unspent (UTXOs haven't been spent)
3. The inscription IDs are valid

This allowed attackers to list arbitrary inscriptions for auction without ownership.

## Fix Implementation

### Changes Made
**File:** `apps/api/src/index.ts` (Lines 527-625)

Added comprehensive server-side verification before auction creation:

```typescript
// ===== SECURITY: Server-side Inscription Ownership Verification =====
// Verify each inscription is owned by the seller and is unspent
// This prevents malicious actors from bypassing client-side checks
```

### Verification Steps

For each inscription in the clearing auction:

1. **Format Validation**
   - Validates inscription ID matches pattern `[0-9a-fA-F]{64}i\d+`
   - Ensures txid is 64 hex characters
   - Verifies vout index is present and numeric

2. **Transaction Verification**
   - Queries mempool.space API: `GET /tx/{txid}`
   - Verifies transaction exists on the network
   - Confirms output at specified vout exists

3. **Ownership Verification**
   - Extracts address from transaction output
   - Compares output address to seller's claimed address
   - Rejects if addresses don't match

4. **Spend Status Verification**
   - Queries mempool.space API: `GET /tx/{txid}/outspends`
   - Verifies UTXO is unspent
   - Rejects if inscription has been transferred/spent

5. **Comprehensive Error Reporting**
   - Collects all verification errors
   - Returns detailed error messages for each failed inscription
   - Includes inscription index for easy identification

### Error Handling

**New Error Code:** `OWNERSHIP_VERIFICATION_FAILED` (HTTP 403)

**Example Error Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "Inscription verification failed:\nInscription 1: Ownership mismatch. Owned by bc1qxyz..., not bc1qabc...\nInscription 3: Already spent and cannot be auctioned",
  "code": "OWNERSHIP_VERIFICATION_FAILED"
}
```

### Security Improvements

1. **All-or-Nothing Verification**
   - If any inscription fails verification, the entire auction is rejected
   - No partial auction creation

2. **Detailed Logging**
   - Logs each successful verification
   - Warns on rejection with error counts
   - Tracks operation metrics for monitoring

3. **Network Error Handling**
   - Catches fetch errors and network issues
   - Reports network errors clearly
   - Fails securely (rejects on error, doesn't proceed)

## Testing Recommendations

### Attack Scenarios to Test

1. **Unowned Inscription Attack**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST /api/clearing/create-auction \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "inscriptionIds": ["someone_elses_inscriptioni0"],
       "sellerAddress": "attacker_address",
       ...
     }'
   ```
   **Expected:** 403 error with ownership mismatch message

2. **Already Spent Inscription**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST /api/clearing/create-auction \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "inscriptionIds": ["spent_inscriptioni0"],
       "sellerAddress": "bc1q...",
       ...
     }'
   ```
   **Expected:** 403 error indicating inscription is spent

3. **Invalid Format Attack**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST /api/clearing/create-auction \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "inscriptionIds": ["invalid-format"],
       "sellerAddress": "bc1q...",
       ...
     }'
   ```
   **Expected:** 403 error with invalid format message

4. **Mixed Valid/Invalid Inscriptions**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST /api/clearing/create-auction \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "inscriptionIds": ["validi0", "invalidi1", "unownedi2"],
       "sellerAddress": "bc1q...",
       ...
     }'
   ```
   **Expected:** 403 error listing all failures

5. **Legitimate Auction Creation**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST /api/clearing/create-auction \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "inscriptionIds": ["owned_unspenti0", "owned_unspenti1"],
       "sellerAddress": "bc1q...",
       ...
     }'
   ```
   **Expected:** 200 success, auction created

## Performance Considerations

### API Call Volume
- Each inscription requires 2 mempool.space API calls:
  1. Transaction details (`/tx/{txid}`)
  2. Outspend status (`/tx/{txid}/outspends`)
- For N inscriptions: **2N API calls**

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Request Batching** (Future Enhancement)
   - Batch requests to mempool.space if supported
   - Reduces total request time

2. **Caching** (Future Enhancement)
   - Cache verification results by inscription ID
   - TTL: 60 seconds (inscriptions rarely change)
   - Reduces redundant API calls

3. **Parallel Verification**
   - Current implementation is sequential
   - Could parallelize with `Promise.all()` for faster verification
   - Trade-off: Higher burst API usage

### Current Performance
- Sequential verification: ~500ms per inscription (network dependent)
- 10 inscriptions: ~5 seconds total
- Acceptable for security-critical operation

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Metrics to Track

1. **Verification Success Rate**
   ```
   successful_verifications / total_verification_attempts
   ```

2. **Verification Rejection Rate by Type**
   - Ownership mismatches
   - Already spent inscriptions
   - Invalid formats
   - Network errors

3. **Average Verification Time**
   - Per inscription
   - Per auction request

4. **mempool.space API Health**
   - Success rate
   - Response times
   - Error rates

### Alert Conditions

1. **High Rejection Rate**
   - Alert if rejection rate > 20% over 1 hour
   - May indicate attack attempts or misconfiguration

2. **Slow Verification**
   - Alert if average verification time > 2 seconds
   - May indicate mempool.space API issues

3. **API Failures**
   - Alert if mempool.space errors > 5% over 15 minutes
   - May require fallback API provider

- ❌ No server-side ownership validation
- ❌ Risk of fraudulent auctions

### After Fix
- ✅ Server-side verification enforced
- ✅ All inscriptions verified before auction creation
- ✅ Ownership and spend status validated
- ✅ Comprehensive error reporting
- ✅ Detailed security logging
- ✅ Fail-secure design

## Related Endpoints

### Also Secured
- `POST /api/create-auction` - Single item auctions (already had verification)

### May Need Review
- Other auction endpoints should be audited for similar vulnerabilities
- Consider adding verification to auction modification endpoints

- **PR Context:** Inscription Ownership Verification feature

## Conclusion

This security fix closes a critical vulnerability that could have allowed malicious actors to create fraudulent auctions for inscriptions they don't own. The server-side verification now matches the rigor of the single auction endpoint, ensuring all clearing auctions are legitimate.
