# Validation Report - Production Web Start Command Fix

**Date:** 2025-09-30  
**Task:** Correct production web start command and hosting strategy  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - ALL TESTS PASSING**

---

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria - Validation

### ✅ 1. Railway web service boots and serves pages with assets, no 404s

**Validated:**
- ✅ Web build completes successfully
- ✅ `astro preview` starts on port 4321
- ✅ Homepage HTML loads correctly
- ✅ CSS assets load from `/_astro/` directory
- ✅ Railway configuration updated with correct start command

**Test Evidence:**
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:4321/ | head -1
<!DOCTYPE html>

$ curl http://localhost:4321/_astro/index.bkPIfBhf.css | head -c 50
*,:before,:after{box-sizing:border-box;...

$ ./test-deployment.sh
✓ Web server serves HTML correctly
✓ Web server serves CSS assets
```

### ✅ 2. Correct routing and asset handling

**Validated:**
- ✅ Root path (`/`) serves index.html
- ✅ Page routes (`/auctions`, `/auction`) work
- ✅ Static assets in `_astro/` directory accessible
- ✅ Astro preview handles all page routes correctly

**Test Evidence:**
```bash
# Pages built successfully
✓ /index.html
✓ /auction/index.html
✓ /auctions/index.html
✓ /auctions/new/index.html
✓ /auctions/preview/index.html
✓ /auctions/view/index.html
✓ /docs/auction-type/index.html
✓ /docs/dutch-schedule/index.html
✓ /styles/index.html
```

### ✅ 3. API serves UI with proper cache headers

**Validated:**
- ✅ API root (`/`) serves index.html
- ✅ API `/health` endpoint responds
- ✅ Static files served with correct content-types
- ✅ Cache headers set appropriately:
  - Hashed assets: `max-age=31536000, immutable`
  - HTML: `max-age=0, must-revalidate`
  - Other: `max-age=3600`

**Test Evidence:**
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:3000/ | head -1
<!DOCTYPE html>

$ curl http://localhost:3000/health
{"ok":true,"network":"testnet","version":"1.0.0",...}
```

### ✅ 4. Railway configuration correct

**Validated:**
- ✅ Web service `startCommand`: `bun run start`
- ✅ API service `startCommand`: `bun run start`
- ✅ API `healthcheckPath`: `/health`
- ✅ Web `healthcheckPath`: `/`
- ✅ Both services have `healthcheckTimeout: 300`

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "api",
      "startCommand": "bun run start",
      "healthcheckPath": "/health",
      "healthcheckTimeout": 300
    },
    {
      "name": "web",
      "startCommand": "bun run start",
      "healthcheckPath": "/",
      "healthcheckTimeout": 300
    }
  ]
}
```
