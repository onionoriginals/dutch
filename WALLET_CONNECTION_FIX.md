# Wallet Connection Fix Summary

## Issue
The connect wallet buttons for Unisat and Xverse were not working properly - clicking the buttons did not trigger the wallet connection flow.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Function Binding Issue
The wallet store functions (`connectWallet`, `disconnectWallet`, `switchNetwork`, `clearError`) were declared as regular functions, which could cause context binding issues when passed as callbacks.

**Fix**: Changed all functions to arrow functions to ensure proper `this` context binding:
```typescript
// Before
function connectWallet(provider: WalletProvider): Promise<void> { ... }

// After  
const connectWallet = async (provider: WalletProvider): Promise<void> => { ... }
```

### 2. Wallet Extension Detection Timing
Wallet browser extensions (Unisat, Xverse) may load after the React component initializes, causing the wallet list to be empty.

**Fix**: Implemented delayed re-checking of available wallets:
- Initial check on component mount
- Re-check after 1 second to catch late-loading extensions
- Modified `initializeStore()` to always re-scan for wallets while only loading from localStorage once

### 3. Event Propagation
The wallet button click handlers could be affected by event bubbling.

**Fix**: Added explicit event handling in the onClick handler:
```typescript
onClick={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  e.stopPropagation()
  handleConnect(provider)
}}
```

### 4. Debugging & Visibility
Lack of console logging made it difficult to diagnose connection issues.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive logging throughout the connection flow:
- `[WalletAdapter]` logs for wallet detection and connection attempts
- `[WalletStore]` logs for store initialization and state changes
- `[WalletButton]` logs for component state and user interactions

## Files Modified

1. **`/workspace/apps/web/src/lib/stores/wallet.ts`**
   - Changed functions to arrow functions
   - Improved initialization logic to re-check wallets
   - Added debug logging

2. **`/workspace/apps/web/src/lib/stores/wallet.react.ts`**
   - Added delayed wallet re-check (1 second timeout)
   - Ensures late-loading wallet extensions are detected

3. **`/workspace/apps/web/src/lib/wallet/walletAdapter.ts`**
   - Added comprehensive debug logging
   - Improved error messages
   - Better visibility into connection flow

4. **`/workspace/apps/web/src/components/ui/WalletButton.tsx`**
   - Fixed event handling with preventDefault/stopPropagation
   - Added component state logging
   - Better error visibility

## How to Test

1. **Check Console Logs**: Open browser DevTools and look for:
   - `[WalletAdapter] Checking wallet capabilities:`
   - `[WalletStore] Available wallets after check:`
   - These will show which wallets are detected

2. **Install Wallet Extensions**:
   - Install [Unisat](https://unisat.io/) or [Xverse](https://www.xverse.app/) browser extension
   - Refresh the page
   - Within 1 second, the wallet should appear in the connect menu

3. **Connect Flow**:
   - Click "Connect wallet" button
   - Menu should show available wallets (unisat/xverse)
   - Click a wallet provider
   - Console should show: `[WalletStore] Attempting to connect to: <provider>`
   - Wallet popup should appear requesting connection
   - After approval, address should display in the UI

## Debugging

If wallets still don't appear:

1. **Check Browser Console** for:
   ```
   [WalletAdapter] Checking wallet capabilities: { hasUnisat: true/false, hasXverse: true/false }
   ```

2. **Verify Extension Installation**:
   ```javascript
   // Run in browser console
   console.log('Unisat:', typeof window.unisat)
   console.log('Xverse:', typeof window.XverseProviders?.BitcoinProvider)
   ```

3. **Check Timing**:
   - Extensions might load very late
   - Try refreshing the page after extension is installed
   - Look for the delayed re-check logs after 1 second

## Additional Notes

- The wallet detection now happens multiple times to catch late-loading extensions
- All connection attempts are logged for easier debugging
- Error messages are displayed via toast notifications
- Network switching automatically disconnects the wallet (user must reconnect)
