# Wallet Connection Fix Summary

## Problem
The wallet connection buttons for Unisat and Xverse were not working. When users clicked on the wallet options, nothing happened because the wallets were not being detected.

## Root Cause
Bitcoin wallet browser extensions (Unisat, Xverse) inject themselves into the `window` object **asynchronously** after the page loads. The wallet detection code was running too early, before the extensions had a chance to initialize, resulting in an empty `availableWallets` array.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Added Wallet Polling Mechanism** (`waitForWallets` function)
Created a new function in `/workspace/apps/web/src/lib/wallet/walletAdapter.ts` that:
- **Polls for wallet extensions** every 100ms for up to 5 seconds
- **Listens for wallet-specific ready events** (`unisat#initialized`, `xverse#initialized`)
- **Resolves immediately** when wallets are found
- **Prevents duplicate resolutions** using a `resolved` flag

```typescript
export function waitForWallets(maxWaitMs: number = 5000, pollIntervalMs: number = 100): Promise<WalletProvider[]>
```

### 2. **Updated Wallet Store Initialization**
Modified `/workspace/apps/web/src/lib/stores/wallet.ts` to:
- Use `async/await` in `initializeStore()`
- Call `waitForWallets()` on first initialization
- Add `walletCheckInProgress` flag to prevent duplicate checks
- Log detailed information about wallet detection progress

### 3. **Simplified React Hook**
Updated `/workspace/apps/web/src/lib/stores/wallet.react.ts` to:
- Remove the duplicate 1-second timeout (now handled by polling)
- Simply call `initializeStore()` once on mount

### 4. **Enhanced UI Feedback**
Improved `/workspace/apps/web/src/components/ui/WalletButton.tsx` to:
- Show a clear message when no wallets are detected
- Provide direct links to install Unisat and Xverse
- Add a "Refresh to detect wallets" button
- Handle the refresh state with loading indicator

## Technical Details

### Before
```typescript
// Old approach - checked once, maybe twice after 1 second
function initializeStore() {
  const wallets = getAvailableWallets()  // Empty if extensions not loaded yet
  $walletState.setKey('availableWallets', wallets)
}
```

### After
```typescript
// New approach - polls until wallets found or timeout
async function initializeStore() {
  if (!isInitialized) {
    const wallets = await waitForWallets(5000, 100)  // Polls every 100ms
    $walletState.setKey('availableWallets', wallets)
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Reliable Detection**: Wallet extensions are now detected reliably, even if they load slowly
2. **Fast Response**: Resolves immediately when wallets are found (not waiting full 5 seconds)
3. **Event-Driven**: Listens for wallet ready events for even faster detection
4. **Better UX**: Users see helpful messages and can refresh if needed
5. **Debugging**: Comprehensive console logging for troubleshooting

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Install Unisat or Xverse browser extension
2. Navigate to the application
3. Click "Connect wallet" button
4. You should see the installed wallet options (unisat/xverse) appear
5. Click on a wallet option to initiate connection
6. The wallet extension popup should appear for authorization

## Console Logs

You should see logs like:
```
[WalletStore] Initializing store... { isInitialized: false }
[WalletStore] Waiting for wallet extensions to load...
[WalletAdapter] Checking wallet capabilities: { hasUnisat: true, hasXverse: false }
[WalletAdapter] Available wallets: ['unisat']
[WalletStore] Available wallets after polling: ['unisat']
[WalletStore] Attempting to connect to: unisat
[WalletAdapter] Connecting to Unisat with network: Testnet
```

## Files Modified

1. `/workspace/apps/web/src/lib/wallet/walletAdapter.ts` - Added `waitForWallets()` function
2. `/workspace/apps/web/src/lib/stores/wallet.ts` - Made `initializeStore()` async with polling
3. `/workspace/apps/web/src/lib/stores/wallet.react.ts` - Simplified initialization
4. `/workspace/apps/web/src/components/ui/WalletButton.tsx` - Enhanced UI feedback

## No Breaking Changes

This fix is **backward compatible** - it doesn't change any public APIs or break existing functionality. It only improves the reliability of wallet detection.
