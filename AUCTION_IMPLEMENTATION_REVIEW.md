# Dutch Auction Implementation Review

**Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Review Scope:** Complete Dutch auction flow for live production auctions

---

## Executive Summary

The codebase has a solid foundation for Dutch auctions with two types:
1. **Single-item Dutch auctions** (buy-now style)
2. **Clearing price Dutch auctions** (uniform price, multiple items)

The backend infrastructure is **production-ready** with comprehensive testing, but the **frontend bidding/payment flow** is incomplete. The main gaps are:
- Wallet integration for signing transactions
- PSBT signing and broadcasting workflow
- Real-time price updates during live auctions
- Payment confirmation and escrow monitoring UI
- Inscription ownership verification UI

---

## Task Breakdown for Completion

Below are discrete, well-scoped tasks that can be completed by separate agents:

---

## üî¥ **CRITICAL PATH TASKS** (Must have for live auctions)

### Task 1: Integrate Bitcoin Wallet Connection
**Priority:** P0 (Blocker)  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** None

**Description:**  
Add wallet connection support to enable users to connect their Bitcoin wallet (Unisat, Leather, or Xverse) for signing transactions.

**Requirements:**
- Install and configure a wallet adapter library (e.g., `sats-connect` for Unisat, or custom adapter)
- Create a React context/provider for wallet state management
- Add wallet connection button in the UI header
- Store connected wallet address and public key
- Handle wallet disconnection
- Display connected wallet address with truncation
- Support testnet and mainnet network switching

**Files to modify:**
- Create: `apps/web/src/lib/wallet/WalletContext.tsx`
- Create: `apps/web/src/lib/wallet/walletAdapter.ts`
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/ui/WalletButton.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/auction/CreateAuctionWizard.tsx` (line 106: replace hardcoded seller address)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- User can click "Connect Wallet" and select a wallet provider
- Wallet address is displayed in the UI when connected
- Seller address field in auction creation is auto-populated from connected wallet
- Wallet connection persists across page reloads (localStorage)
- Clear error messages for wallet connection failures

---

### Task 2: Implement PSBT Signing Workflow for Auction Creation
**Priority:** P0 (Blocker)  
**Estimated Effort:** Large  
**Dependencies:** Task 1

**Description:**  
Build the complete PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction) signing workflow so sellers can escrow their inscription into the auction address.

**Requirements:**
- After auction creation API call, display the returned PSBT to the seller
- Use wallet adapter to request PSBT signature from connected wallet
- Broadcast the signed transaction to the Bitcoin network (via mempool.space API)
- Poll for transaction confirmation (at least 1 confirmation)
- Update auction status to "active" only after inscription is escrowed
- Display transaction ID and mempool link
- Handle signing failures with retry mechanism

**Files to modify:**
- Create: `apps/web/src/lib/bitcoin/psbtSigner.ts`
- Create: `apps/web/src/lib/bitcoin/broadcastTransaction.ts`
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/auction/CreateAuctionWizard.tsx` (onSubmit handler)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/index.ts` (POST `/api/create-auction` - enhance with real PSBT generation)

**API Enhancements needed:**
- `POST /api/create-auction` should return a valid PSBT with inscription input and auction address output
- Currently generates placeholder PSBT - needs real implementation using `bitcoinjs-lib`

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Seller sees "Sign with wallet" prompt after auction creation
- PSBT is properly constructed with inscription UTXO as input
- Wallet popup displays PSBT details for approval
- Transaction is broadcast to Bitcoin network (testnet for testing)
- UI polls mempool API and shows "Waiting for confirmation..." status
- Auction becomes active after 1 confirmation
- Transaction hash is stored in auction record

---

### Task 3: Build Bidding Interface with Payment Flow
**Priority:** P0 (Blocker)

- Call `POST /api/clearing/create-bid-payment` to get escrow address and bidId
- Generate payment PSBT sending bid amount from user's wallet to escrow address
- User signs payment PSBT with wallet
- Broadcast payment transaction
- Poll for confirmation and call `POST /api/clearing/confirm-bid-payment` after 1 confirmation
- Display bid status (payment_pending ‚Üí payment_confirmed ‚Üí settled)

**Files to modify:**
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/auction/BiddingInterface.tsx`
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/auction/PaymentPSBTModal.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/web/src/react/auctions/View.tsx` (add bidding UI)
- Modify: `apps/api/src/index.ts` (enhance payment PSBT generation)

**API Enhancements needed:**
- `POST /api/clearing/create-bid-payment` should generate real payment PSBT (currently returns mock escrow address)
- PSBT should have user's UTXO(s) as inputs and escrow address as output

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Bidder can enter quantity and see total bid amount
- "Place Bid" generates payment PSBT with correct inputs/outputs
- Wallet prompts user to sign payment transaction
- Transaction broadcasts successfully
- UI polls and shows "Payment pending confirmation..."
- Bid status updates to "payment_confirmed" after 1 confirmation
- Bidder can see their bid in the auction's bid list

### Task 4: Implement Real-Time Price Updates
**Priority:** P0 (Blocker)  
**Estimated Effort:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** None

**Description:**  
Add real-time price updates to auction detail pages so users see the current Dutch auction price decreasing over time.

**Requirements:**
- Use `setInterval` or `requestAnimationFrame` to update price display every second
- Calculate current price using `priceAtTime` from `@originals/dutch/schedule`
- Display countdown timer showing time until next price drop
- Show price history sparkline chart
- Highlight price changes with animation
- Stop updates when auction ends or is sold

**Files to modify:**
- Create: `apps/web/src/components/auction/LivePriceDisplay.tsx`
- Create: `apps/web/src/hooks/useLivePrice.ts`
- Modify: `apps/web/src/react/auctions/View.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/auction/AuctionCard.tsx`

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Price updates every second without page refresh
- Countdown timer shows "Next drop in: 5s"
- Price changes are animated/highlighted
- Sparkline shows price history over last 5 minutes
- Updates stop when auction ends
- No unnecessary API calls (calculate client-side)

- Show clear error if seller doesn't own inscription or if already spent
- Add loading state during verification

**Files to modify:**
- Modify: `apps/api/src/index.ts` (POST `/api/create-auction` - already has basic implementation, enhance error handling)
- Create: `apps/web/src/lib/bitcoin/verifyInscription.ts` (client-side verification)
- Modify: `apps/web/src/components/auction/CreateAuctionWizard.tsx` (add pre-submission verification)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- API returns 403 error if seller doesn't own inscription
- API returns 403 error if inscription UTXO is already spent
