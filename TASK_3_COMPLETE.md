## API Endpoints Used

All endpoints were implemented in Task 2 and are fully functional:

1. ✅ `POST /api/clearing/create-bid-payment` - Creates bid, returns escrow address
2. ✅ `POST /api/clearing/confirm-bid-payment` - Confirms transaction broadcast
3. ✅ `GET /api/clearing/bid-payment-status/:bidId` - Polls for confirmation
4. ✅ `GET /api/clearing/bids/:auctionId` - Retrieves all bids
5. ✅ `GET /api/clearing/status/:auctionId` - Gets auction status

---

## Technical Highlights

### 1. State Management
```typescript
type BidState = {
  quantity: number
  isSubmitting: boolean
  error: string | null
  showPaymentModal: boolean
  paymentData: { escrowAddress, bidId, bidAmount, quantity } | null
}
```
Clean, type-safe state management with proper error handling.

### 2. Payment Flow States
```typescript
type PaymentState = {
  step: 'payment' | 'broadcasting' | 'confirming' | 'complete' | 'error'
  transactionId: string | null
  error: string | null
  confirmations: number
}
```
Clear state transitions with visual feedback at each step.

### 3. Polling Implementation
```typescript
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (state.step === 'confirming' && state.transactionId) {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      checkConfirmation(state.transactionId!)
    }, 10000)
    return () => clearInterval(interval)
  }
}, [state.step, state.transactionId])
```
Efficient polling with automatic cleanup.

### 4. Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Dark mode support throughout
- Proper spacing and typography
- Accessible color contrasts
