# Merge Conflict Resolution Summary

## Overview
Successfully resolved merge conflicts between the inscription verification feature branch and the main branch that included wallet connection improvements.

## Conflicts Identified

### File: `apps/web/src/components/auction/CreateAuctionWizard.tsx`

**Two conflict locations:**

1. **Import Statements (Lines 10-14)**
   - **HEAD (our branch):** Added `verifyMultipleInscriptions` verification imports
   - **main branch:** Added `useWallet` hook import
   - **Resolution:** Keep BOTH imports - they serve different purposes

2. **Seller Address (Lines 156-160)**
   - **HEAD (our branch):** Used manual `sellerAddress` from form input
   - **main branch:** Used `wallet.paymentAddress` from connected wallet
   - **Resolution:** Prefer wallet address, fallback to manual input

## Resolution Strategy

### Merged Imports
```typescript
// BEFORE (conflicted):
<<<<<<< HEAD
import { verifyMultipleInscriptions, checkAllValid, type Network } from '../../lib/bitcoin/verifyInscription'
=======
import { useWallet } from '../../lib/stores/wallet.react'
>>>>>>> origin/main

// AFTER (resolved):
import { verifyMultipleInscriptions, checkAllValid, type Network } from '../../lib/bitcoin/verifyInscription'
import { useWallet } from '../../lib/stores/wallet.react'
```

### Smart Seller Address Selection
```typescript
// BEFORE (conflicted):
<<<<<<< HEAD
sellerAddress: sellerAddress,
=======
sellerAddress: wallet.paymentAddress,
>>>>>>> origin/main

// AFTER (resolved):
sellerAddress: wallet?.paymentAddress || sellerAddress,
```

### Enhanced Verification Logic
```typescript
// Get seller address (prefer wallet address, fallback to manual input)
const sellerAddress = wallet?.paymentAddress || values.sellerAddress?.trim() || ''

if (!sellerAddress) {
  throw new Error('Seller address is required. Please connect your wallet or enter an address manually.')
}
```

## Benefits of Resolution

### 1. Best of Both Worlds ✅
- **Wallet Integration:** When wallet is connected, automatically uses wallet address
- **Manual Input:** Still supports manual address input as fallback
- **Verification:** Both paths go through inscription ownership verification

### 2. Enhanced User Experience
- **Connected Wallet:** Seamless experience with auto-filled address
- **No Wallet:** Can still create auctions by entering address manually
- **Clear Feedback:** UI shows wallet connection status

### 3. Security Maintained
- Both wallet address and manual address go through same verification
- Server-side verification remains enforced
- No security compromises made

## User Flow

### With Wallet Connected
```
1. User connects wallet
2. Wallet address shown in UI
3. User enters inscription IDs
4. Client-side verification (using wallet address)
5. Server-side verification (using wallet address)
6. Auction created ✓
```

### Without Wallet (Manual)
```
1. User sees "wallet not connected" warning
2. User enters inscription IDs
3. User enters seller address manually
4. Client-side verification (using manual address)
5. Server-side verification (using manual address)
6. Auction created ✓
```

## Code Changes Summary

### Modified Functions

1. **`onSubmit` callback**
   - Added wallet address preference logic
   - Updated error messages to mention both options
   - Maintains backward compatibility

2. **UI Components**
   - Wallet connection status display (from main branch)
   - Manual address input field (from feature branch)
   - Both coexist harmoniously

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Cases

1. **Wallet Connected - Valid Inscription**
   ```
   - Connect wallet
   - Enter valid inscription owned by wallet
   - Verify auction creation succeeds
   ```

2. **Wallet Connected - Invalid Inscription**
   ```
   - Connect wallet
   - Enter inscription NOT owned by wallet
   - Verify verification fails with clear error
   ```

3. **No Wallet - Manual Address**
   ```
   - Don't connect wallet
   - Enter inscription IDs
   - Enter seller address manually
   - Verify auction creation succeeds
   ```

4. **No Wallet - No Address**
   ```
   - Don't connect wallet
   - Don't enter seller address
   - Verify clear error message
   ```

5. **Wallet Overrides Manual**
   ```
   - Connect wallet
   - Enter different address manually
   - Verify wallet address is used (preferred)
   ```

## Compatibility

### Backward Compatibility ✅
- Manual address input still works
- Existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes

### Forward Compatibility ✅
- Wallet integration ready
- Extensible for future wallet features
- Clean architecture
