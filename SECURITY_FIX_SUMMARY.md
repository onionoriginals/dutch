# Security Fix Summary: Clearing Auction Server-Side Verification

## Overview
Fixed a critical security vulnerability (P1) in the clearing auction endpoint that allowed malicious actors to bypass client-side verification and create fraudulent auctions for inscriptions they don't own.

## Vulnerability Details

### Issue
The `POST /api/clearing/create-auction` endpoint only validated parameter presence but did not verify inscription ownership or spend status server-side. This allowed attackers to:
- List inscriptions they don't own
- Auction already-spent inscriptions
- Bypass all client-side security checks

### Impact
- **Severity:** P1 (Critical)
- **Attack Vector:** Direct API POST requests
- **Risk:** Fraudulent auction listings, user trust violation, potential financial loss

## Fix Implemented

### Code Changes
**File:** `apps/api/src/index.ts`
**Lines:** 527-631
**Added:** ~100 lines of server-side verification logic

### Security Enhancements

1. **Inscription Format Validation**
   ```typescript
   // Validates inscription ID format: [0-9a-fA-F]{64}i\d+
   const inscriptionRegex = /^[0-9a-fA-F]{64}i\d+$/
   ```

2. **Transaction Verification**
   ```typescript
   // Queries mempool.space to verify transaction exists
   const txResp = await fetch(`${base}/tx/${txid}`)
   ```

3. **Ownership Verification**
   ```typescript
   // Ensures output address matches seller's claimed address
   const ownerMatches = outputAddress === sellerAddress
   ```

4. **Spend Status Check**
   ```typescript
   // Verifies UTXO is unspent
   const outspendsResp = await fetch(`${base}/tx/${txid}/outspends`)
   const spent = !!outspend?.spent
   ```

5. **All-or-Nothing Verification**
   - If ANY inscription fails, entire auction is rejected
   - Prevents partial/incomplete auction creation

6. **Comprehensive Error Reporting**
   - Detailed error messages for each failed inscription
   - Includes inscription index for easy identification
   - Clear error codes for programmatic handling

### New Error Code
**`OWNERSHIP_VERIFICATION_FAILED`** (HTTP 403)
- Returned when one or more inscriptions fail verification
- Includes detailed breakdown of all failures
- Format: Multi-line error with per-inscription details

## Security Comparison

### Before Fix ❌
```
Client Request
    ↓
Client-side Verification (can be bypassed)
    ↓
Direct API POST (no verification)
    ↓
Auction Created ⚠️  (potentially fraudulent)
```

### After Fix ✅
```
Client Request
    ↓
Client-side Verification (pre-check)
    ↓
API POST with verification
    ↓
Server-side Verification (enforced)
    ├── Format Check
    ├── Transaction Check
    ├── Ownership Check
    └── Spend Check
    ↓
Auction Created ✓ (verified legitimate)
```

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Unowned inscription rejection
- ✅ Already spent inscription rejection
- ✅ Invalid format rejection
- ✅ Mixed valid/invalid inscriptions
- ✅ Legitimate auction creation
- ✅ Network error handling

### Test Commands
See `SECURITY_FIX_CLEARING_AUCTION.md` for detailed test scenarios.

## Performance Impact

### API Call Overhead
- **Per Inscription:** 2 mempool.space API calls
- **10 Inscriptions:** ~5 seconds (sequential, network-dependent)
- **Trade-off:** Acceptable for security-critical operation

### Future Optimizations
- Request batching
- Result caching (60s TTL)
- Parallel verification with Promise.all()

## Monitoring & Logging

### Added Logging
```typescript
// Success log per inscription
logger.info('Clearing auction inscription verified', {
  operation: 'clearing-inscription-verification',
  inscriptionId,
  index: i + 1,
  ownerMatches,
  spent: false,
})

// Warning on rejection
logger.warn('Clearing auction creation rejected', {
  operation: 'clearing-auction-verification-failed',
  sellerAddress,
  inscriptionCount: inscriptionIds.length,
  errorCount: verificationErrors.length,
})
```

### Metrics to Monitor
1. Verification success/failure rates
2. Average verification time
3. Error type distribution
4. mempool.space API health

### Endpoints Now Secured
1. ✅ `POST /api/create-auction` - Single item (already secured)
2. ✅ `POST /api/clearing/create-auction` - Multi-item (now secured)
