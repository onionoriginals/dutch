# Task 5: Inscription Ownership Verification - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented inscription ownership verification for the auction system, ensuring that sellers actually own the inscriptions they attempt to auction before allowing auction creation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Client-Side Verification Utility
**File:** `apps/web/src/lib/bitcoin/verifyInscription.ts` (NEW)

Created a comprehensive Bitcoin inscription ownership verification module with the following features:

- **Parse Inscription IDs:** Validates and parses inscription IDs in the format `<txid>i<vout>`
- **Network Support:** Works on mainnet, testnet, signet, and regtest
- **mempool.space Integration:** Queries mempool.space API for transaction and outspend data
- **Triple Verification:**
  1. Transaction exists and output is found
  2. Output address matches seller's address
  3. Output has not been spent (UTXO is unspent)
- **Multi-Inscription Support:** Batch verification for clearing auctions with multiple items
- **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Clear error messages for each failure scenario

**Key Functions:**
- `parseInscriptionId()` - Validates and parses inscription IDs
- `verifyInscriptionOwnership()` - Main verification function
- `verifyMultipleInscriptions()` - Batch verification
- `checkAllValid()` - Validates array of verification results
- `getMempoolApiBase()` - Network-aware API URL selection

### 2. Enhanced API Error Handling
**File:** `apps/api/src/index.ts` (MODIFIED)

Enhanced the `POST /api/create-auction` endpoint with:

- **Better Error Messages:** 
  - Ownership mismatch now shows both actual and expected addresses
  - Transaction not found includes network context
  - Output not found includes specific txid and vout
  - Already spent has clear user-friendly message

- **Error Codes:**
  - `OWNERSHIP_MISMATCH` (403) - Seller doesn't own the inscription
  - `ALREADY_SPENT` (403) - Inscription UTXO has been spent
  - `NOT_FOUND` (404) - Transaction not found
  - `OUTPUT_NOT_FOUND` (404) - Output doesn't exist in transaction

### 3. Updated Validation Schema
**File:** `apps/web/src/lib/validation/auction.ts` (MODIFIED)

- Added `sellerAddress` field to `DutchAuctionSchema`
- Added Bitcoin address format validation (supports bc1, tb1, legacy addresses)
- Updated step fields to include seller address in the Items step

### 4. Enhanced Create Auction Wizard
**File:** `apps/web/src/components/auction/CreateAuctionWizard.tsx` (MODIFIED)

Added comprehensive verification workflow:

- **New UI Fields:**
  - Seller Bitcoin Address input field with validation
  - Clear instructions about ownership verification

- **Pre-Submission Verification:**
  - Verifies all inscription IDs before PSBT generation
  - Network-aware verification (reads from `PUBLIC_BITCOIN_NETWORK`)
  - Prevents auction creation if verification fails

- **Loading States:**
  - "Verifying inscription ownership..." indicator
  - "Creating auction..." indicator
  - Disabled buttons during processing

- **User-Friendly Error Messages:**
  - Displays verification errors with context
  - Maps API error codes to helpful messages
  - Shows specific issues for each inscription

- **Review Screen:**
  - Displays seller address before submission
  - Shows all inscriptions being verified

### 5. Unit Tests
**File:** `apps/web/src/lib/bitcoin/verifyInscription.test.ts` (NEW)

Created comprehensive test suite covering:
- Valid inscription ID parsing
- Invalid format detection
- Network API URL selection
- Edge cases and error conditions

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ **API returns 403 error if seller doesn't own inscription**
- Implementation: Lines 1002-1017 in `apps/api/src/index.ts`
- Error code: `OWNERSHIP_MISMATCH`
- Enhanced message includes actual owner address

✅ **API returns 403 error if inscription UTXO is already spent**
- Implementation: Lines 1011-1017 in `apps/api/src/index.ts`
- Error code: `ALREADY_SPENT`
- Clear user-facing message

✅ **Frontend shows user-friendly error messages**
- Implementation: Lines 159-165 in `apps/web/src/components/auction/CreateAuctionWizard.tsx`
- Context-aware error display with visual indicators

✅ **Verification happens before PSBT generation**
- Implementation: Lines 105-122 in `apps/web/src/components/auction/CreateAuctionWizard.tsx`
- Client-side verification before API call
- Server-side verification also in place for double-check

✅ **Works on testnet and mainnet**
- Network detection from environment variable `PUBLIC_BITCOIN_NETWORK`
- Defaults to testnet for safety
- Supports mainnet, testnet, signet, and regtest

## Security Considerations

1. **Double Verification:** Both client-side (pre-submission) and server-side (API) verification
2. **Network Validation:** Ensures verification happens on the correct Bitcoin network
3. **UTXO State Check:** Prevents auction of already-spent inscriptions
4. **Address Format Validation:** Regex validation for Bitcoin addresses

## API Integration

### mempool.space API Endpoints Used

1. `GET /api/tx/{txid}` - Fetch transaction details
   - Returns: Transaction with outputs (vout array)
   - Used to: Verify inscription exists and get owner address

2. `GET /api/tx/{txid}/outspends` - Check output spend status
   - Returns: Array of outspend statuses
   - Used to: Ensure UTXO is unspent

### Error Handling Flow

```
Client Submit
    ↓
Client-side verification (verifyInscription.ts)
    ↓
[FAIL] → Show error to user, stop submission
[PASS] → Send to API
    ↓
Server-side verification (index.ts)
    ↓
[FAIL] → Return 403 with error code
[PASS] → Create auction
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

1. **Valid Inscription (Happy Path)**
   ```
   - Use a real unspent inscription on testnet
   - Enter correct seller address
   - Verify successful auction creation
   ```

2. **Ownership Mismatch**
   ```
   - Use a real inscription
   - Enter wrong seller address
   - Verify 403 error with ownership details
   ```

3. **Already Spent**
   ```
   - Use an inscription that's been transferred
   - Verify 403 error about spent UTXO
   ```

4. **Invalid Inscription ID**
   ```
   - Use malformed inscription ID
   - Verify validation error
   ```

5. **Network Mismatch**
   ```
   - Try mainnet inscription on testnet network
   - Verify "not found" error
   ```

### Automated Testing

Run unit tests:
```bash
bun test apps/web/src/lib/bitcoin/verifyInscription.test.ts
```

## Environment Variables

- `PUBLIC_BITCOIN_NETWORK` - Sets the Bitcoin network (mainnet|testnet|signet|regtest)
  - Frontend: Used for client-side verification
  - Backend: Already configured via `BITCOIN_NETWORK`

## Future Enhancements

1. **Wallet Integration:** Auto-fill seller address from connected wallet
2. **Inscription Preview:** Show inscription content during verification
3. **Batch Status:** Progress indicator for multi-inscription verification
4. **Caching:** Cache verification results for duplicate inscriptions
5. **Retry Logic:** Automatic retry for transient network errors

## Dependencies

- `fetch` API (built-in) - For mempool.space API calls
- `zod` - For schema validation
- No additional npm packages required

## Files Modified/Created

1. `apps/web/src/lib/bitcoin/verifyInscription.ts` - Main verification utility
2. `apps/web/src/lib/bitcoin/verifyInscription.test.ts` - Unit tests
3. `INSCRIPTION_VERIFICATION_SUMMARY.md` - This document

### Modified
1. `apps/api/src/index.ts` - Enhanced error handling

## Conclusion

The inscription ownership verification feature is fully implemented and ready for testing. It provides a secure, user-friendly way to ensure sellers own the inscriptions they're auctioning, preventing fraud and improving trust in the auction system.
