# Observability and Log Redaction Implementation

## Summary

This implementation adds comprehensive observability features to the Dutch auction API, including structured logging, automatic PII/sensitive data redaction, enhanced health monitoring, and request/response tracking.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Files Created

#### `apps/api/src/utils/logger.ts`
A complete structured logging utility with:
- **Multi-level logging**: debug, info, warn, error
- **Automatic PII redaction**: Removes sensitive data from all logs
- **JSON output mode**: Configurable for production log aggregation
- **HTTP request/response helpers**: Specialized methods for web traffic
- **Configurable via environment**: LOG_LEVEL and LOG_FORMAT variables

**Key Features:**
- Detects and redacts: private keys, seed phrases, API keys, passwords, ownership addresses
- Preserves safe data: IDs, prices, timestamps, status values
- Works with nested objects and arrays
- Zero configuration needed - works out of the box

#### `apps/api/src/__tests__/logger.test.ts`
Comprehensive test suite with 19 tests covering:
- ✓ Seed phrase redaction (field name and pattern matching)
- ✓ Private key redaction (hex strings and field names)
- ✓ API key and token redaction
- ✓ Ownership data redaction (sellerAddress, ownerAddress, buyerAddress)
- ✓ Nested object and array redaction
- ✓ Safe value preservation
- ✓ Structured logging functionality

**Test Results:** All 19 tests passing

#### `apps/api/OBSERVABILITY.md`
Complete documentation including:
- Usage examples and best practices
- Configuration options
- Monitoring recommendations
- Security considerations
- Integration with log aggregation systems

### 2. Modified Files

#### `apps/api/src/index.ts`
**Added:**
- Import of logger utility
- Server start time tracking for uptime metrics
- Request logging middleware (onRequest hook)
- Enhanced error handler with structured logging
- Improved /health endpoint with:
  - DB connectivity test with response time
  - Uptime metrics (ms, seconds, human-readable)
  - Environment information (Node env, platform, Bun version)
  - Health status: "healthy" or "degraded"
  - Timestamp in ISO 8601 format
- Ownership verification logging with automatic redaction
- Startup logging with service configuration

**Key Improvements:**
- All console.log calls replaced with structured logger
- Errors logged with full context (method, path, stack trace)
- Static assets and /health excluded from request logs to reduce noise
- Server startup logs configuration details

#### `apps/api/src/services/db.ts`
**Added:**
- Import of logger and redactSensitiveData
- Enhanced logAudit function that:
  - Applies automatic redaction to all audit entries
  - Logs to structured logger for observability
  - Maintains existing audit log storage

**Result:** All sensitive operations (seed import/rotation, recovery, monitoring) now have redacted logs

### 3. Dependencies
No new dependencies added - implementation uses only built-in Node.js/Bun APIs

## Acceptance Criteria Met

### ✅ No PII/keys in logs
- Automatic redaction of private keys, seed phrases, passwords, API keys
- Ownership addresses (sellerAddress, ownerAddress, buyerAddress) redacted
- 19 comprehensive tests verify redaction works correctly
- Demonstrated with real-world examples

### ✅ Structured JSON logs
- All logs include timestamp, level, message, and context
- Configurable JSON output via LOG_FORMAT environment variable
- Request/response logging with type classification
- Error logging with stack traces and context

### ✅ /health includes status and version
Enhanced health endpoint returns:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "ok": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-09-30T07:36:57.348Z",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "network": "testnet",
  "uptime": { "milliseconds": 53, "seconds": 0, "human": "0m 0s" },
  "database": { "connected": true, "responseTimeMs": 1 },
  "counts": { "active": 4, "sold": 0, "expired": 0, "total": 4 },
  "environment": { "nodeEnv": "development", "platform": "bun", "bunVersion": "1.2.23" }
}
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
bun test src/__tests__/logger.test.ts
```
Result: **19 tests passing** covering all redaction scenarios

### Manual Testing
Created and executed comprehensive test scripts demonstrating:
- Enhanced health endpoint with all new fields
- Structured logging at different levels
- Automatic redaction of sensitive data
- HTTP request/response logging
- Error logging with context
- Audit log redaction

### Regression Testing
- Verified existing tests pass/fail in same way before and after changes
- No new test failures introduced by observability features
- Logger middleware skips static assets to avoid test interference

## Usage Examples

### Basic Logging
```typescript
import { logger } from './utils/logger'

logger.info('Auction created', { 
  auctionId: 'auction-123', 
  price: 50000 
})
// Output: [2025-09-30T07:42:13.813Z] INFO: Auction created {"auctionId":"auction-123","price":50000}
```

### Automatic Redaction
```typescript
logger.info('Seed import', { 
  seed: 'abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon abandon about',
  userId: '123'
})
// Output: [2025-09-30T07:42:13.813Z] INFO: Seed import {"seed":"[REDACTED]","userId":"123"}
```

### HTTP Logging
```typescript
logger.request('POST', '/api/auctions')
logger.response('POST', '/api/auctions', 201, 125.5)
// Output: [2025-09-30T07:42:13.813Z] INFO: POST /api/auctions {"type":"request"}
// Output: [2025-09-30T07:42:13.813Z] INFO: POST /api/auctions 201 {"type":"response","status":201,"durationMs":125.5}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Development (human-readable)
LOG_LEVEL=info LOG_FORMAT=text bun run dev

# Production (JSON for log aggregation)
NODE_ENV=production LOG_FORMAT=json LOG_LEVEL=warn bun start

# Debug mode
LOG_LEVEL=debug bun run dev
```

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. `/health` endpoint status field
2. Database connectivity and response time
3. Server uptime
4. Auction counts (detect anomalies)
5. Error rate from logs (level=error)

### Log Aggregation
With `LOG_FORMAT=json`, logs can be ingested by:
- Datadog
- Elasticsearch + Kibana
- CloudWatch Logs
- Grafana Loki
- Splunk

Example Loki query for errors:
```logql
{app="dutch-api"} | json | level="error" | line_format "{{.message}}"
```

## Security Considerations

### Implemented Safeguards
- ✅ Private keys never appear in logs
- ✅ Seed phrases automatically redacted
- ✅ API keys and tokens masked
- ✅ Ownership addresses redacted where sensitive
- ✅ Passwords always filtered

### Recommendations
- Consider rate-limiting audit log access
- Implement log retention policies (e.g., 90 days)
- Restrict access to log aggregation systems
- Regularly audit redaction patterns for completeness

## Risks Addressed

### Rate-Limiting Audit Logs
The current implementation stores all audit logs in memory. For production:
- Consider implementing a max size limit
- Add log rotation or TTL
- Move to persistent storage with retention policies
- Add rate limiting on sensitive operations

**Mitigation:** Documentation includes recommendations for production hardening

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal overhead**: Redaction only applied to logged data
- **Request logging**: Excludes static assets and health checks
- **Health endpoint**: Adds ~1ms for DB connectivity test
- **Memory usage**: In-memory audit logs bounded by operation volume

## Future Enhancements

Documented in OBSERVABILITY.md:
- [ ] Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- [ ] Prometheus metrics endpoint
- [ ] Request ID propagation
- [ ] Log sampling for high-volume endpoints
- [ ] Configurable redaction patterns
- [ ] Persistent audit log storage
